    question: 'Is this really free?',
    answer:
      "Yep, the app is free and open source. The hosted version is free for now, but might need a small fee later to cover server costs. We'll be upfront about it when that happens.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Where does the movie data come from?',
    answer:
      "We use The Movie Database (TMDB) API. They have a huge collection of movies and TV shows with all the details you'd want.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I self-host this?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely! That's kind of the point. Fork the repo, spin up a Docker container, and you're good to go. Full control, full privacy.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from Letterboxd/Trakt?',
    answer:
      "We're focused on privacy and self-hosting. No tracking, no selling your data, no algorithm trying to manipulate what you watch. Plus, you can run your own instance.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data safe?',
    answer:
      "On the hosted version, we store only what's necessary and don't share it with anyone. But if you're extra cautious, self-host it. Your server, your data.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I contribute to the project?',
    answer: 'Yes please! Check out the GitHub repo. Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are all welcome.',
